1. step-by-step guide
    - Get Python >= 2.5 ( e.g. from http://www.python.org ).
    - If you can read this file you probably already got the svn-sources.
      If not, get an svn client, preferrably TortoiseSVN ( from 
      http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads ).
    - If you have not done already: make up a directory kderoot somewhere;
      We will refer to it as %KDEROOT% or just kderoot - the name is not
      important at all though.
    - Put another directory emerge into %KDEROOT% enter that directory
      and checkout from svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/trunk/kdesupport/emerge .
    - Add another directory etc to %KDEROOT%. Copy the file 
      kdesettings-example.bat from the emerge directory into the etc 
      directory. Rename kdesettings-example.bat to kdesettings.bat and edit it
      according to your needs.
    - open up kdeenv.bat from the emerge directory, try 'emerge -p kdebase'
      and if there are no errors, you can use emerge.

2. running emerge
Call "emerge --help" to get the current documentation
how to call emerge, its recognized commands and options.
(Alternatively open emerge.py in your text editor to read the same text.)

3. the environment and the directory layout
For running emerge in a preset environment, please use the kdeenv.bat. this
will set all Environment variables for you that are needed to build KDE4.
Please be aware that cygwin shouldn't be in your path.
KDE on windows uses a special layout that might change in future releases.
Below %KDEROOT% you will find common unix folders such as bin, lib and etc.
There are some special folders that have another meaning though:
\emerge     This folder contains the portage directory, the emerge scripts
            within the folder bin, this README and the kdesettings-example.bat
\tmp        This folder contains the build directories of all packages.
            After finishing with emerge, you can empty this folder.
\etc        this folder contains lots of settings.
\bin        Contains all executables and all shared libraries.
\lib        Contains all non-shared libraries.
\include    Contains header files.
\share      Contains lots of additional stuff: Wallpapers,mimetype definitions
            and some more.
\mingw      This folder only exists if you install mingw or gdb with emerge.
            The kdeenv.bat will include this folder into the path for you.
            You can of course use this compiler outside of KDE as well.

4. remarks to the step-by-step guide
    - Get Python >= 2.5 ( e.g. from http://www.python.org ).

Python should be within your path ( which is normally set automatically ).
You don't have to register python with the file ending .py though the author
of these lines finds it useful.


    - If you can read this file you probably already got the svn-sources.
      If not, get an svn client, preferrably TortoiseSVN ( from 
      http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads ).

TortoiseSVN is an extension to the Windows Explorer and a full featured svn
client. It makes development easy. The point in not using a commandline client
is that emerge will not check for an installed commandline client yet.


    - If you have not done already: make up a directory kderoot somewhere;
      We will refer to it as %KDEROOT% or just kderoot - the name is not
      important at all though.

As already stated the name isn't really important. Currently all KDE files
will be installed under KDEROOT, but this might change in the future. 


    - Put another directory emerge into %KDEROOT% enter that directory
      and checkout from svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/trunk/kdesupport/emerge .
      
If you want to directly work on emerge itself, please checkout from the normal
svn server instead.

      
    - Add another directory etc to %KDEROOT%. Copy the file 
      kdesettings-example.bat from the emerge directory into the etc 
      directory. Rename kdesettings-example.bat to kdesettings.bat and edit it
      according to your needs.
      
The file kdesettings-example.bat should contain all necessary informations.
You should read at that point.


    - open up kdeenv.bat from the emerge directory, try 'emerge -p kdebase'
      and if there are no errors, you can use emerge.

You will get a list of packages that emerge would try to build.
You can most of the time ignore warning messages - they are mostly for your
information.
