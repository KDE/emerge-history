"""Tool to use emerge in 'make -k' and 'make -j' way.

   When emerging a more complex package depending on several
   sub packages it is likely that emerge dies for some reasons 
   at different parts of process. Without this tool you are
   forced to fix the detected problem one after the other
   and start the emerging again and again.

   The 'emerge -k' does not stop at the first error and
   builds as much as its possible to generate a maximal
   error report.

   In the dependency graph of an emerge target some parts
   are independent from each other so it is possible to
   build them parallel. This goes beyond a classical 'make -j'
   because having this feature at emerge level you are
   able get fetch sources of one package and compile another.

   Usage:

   Preconditon: Set the environment variables used by emerge.

   $ python bin/parallel.py -j <# workers> -c <command>

   with <# workers> is the number of parallel running jobs.
   Defaults to the number of processor cores of the machine.

   <command> is template for the command to be executed
   for each sub package. Defaults to:
   'python emerge.py %(category)s/%(package)s'

   category, package, version and tag are subsituted
   in the command string before being executed.
