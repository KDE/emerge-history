Contains the emerge scripts for building the Enterprise4 version of Kontact.

Purpose:
1) build entirely from source
2) use -mms-bitfields option throughout
3) experiment at will without breaking for anyone else


Todo:
figure out how to build the following from source

Priority top first.

* cyrus-sasl
	Needed to log in for some connects, thus important.
* openldap
	Needed for KAddressbook LDAP search
* exiv2
* expat
* gettext
* giflib
* iconv
* jpeg
* libxslt
* libxml2
* shared-mime-info
* sqlite
* zlib
* aspell

* gpgme
Lesser priority because http://gpg4win.org/ is already build with
-mmsbitfields and has a working source code installer and build system
on GNU/Linux.
