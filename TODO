this is a list of things that could be done to improve emerge:

- implement "emerge --digest package":
this would create a digest file for the files needed for this package.
the advantage would be that it would not be necessary to have internet
connection to build a package any more. right now every time a package 
is built emerge tries to fetch the package, because it does not know,
if the downloaded files are complete. with a digest file it would be possible
to check if the files are already complete without an internet connection.
for ideas and code how to do so, look at the gentoo portage system.
(pretty much unclear to me)

- think of a fail proof versioning system - a script from today should stay executable at least for the next
  two minor KDE versions.
  
- replace current implementation of option handling with a better one:
  use a parser function that returns the options as a list.
  Maybe there are already implementations for that?

- include the *_build.py as modules directly into the build scripts - this gives back the possibility to
  overload functions and thus reimplement them.
  
- implement an option -r (recursive) so that options behind this option are given to all dependencies
  this is needed so that e.g. 'emerge.py --target=4.0 kdebase' will build only the 4.0 target and will
  not depend on the svnHEAD.

- implement an option --update which updates installed svn packages (e.g. with target svnHEAD)
  this will replace 'emerge.py --unmerge package --noclean package'

- make the internal system target aware
  the 4.0 branch definitely needs this since it should neither depend on trunk of kdesupport nor should
  we introduce new static packages for that purpose.
  
- introduce the special target svnREV[XXXXXX] where XXXXXX is a revision number (why not use svn[XXXXXXX] ?).
  this needs some work on the internal implementation for interacting with subversion client.

- implement a better option transmission between calling emerge script and executed package script
## note: started; the import of the file makes complete transmission possible

- implement a function for making the settings readable by the app without the use environment vars

- make up a package for the installer
- as well with the installer:
    can there be a custom app to translate .desktop files to .lnk files?
## kdewin-menubuilder takes over this task for now, might be released soon in a better version

## - implement "emerge --version=version":
## instead of using a different package name for each alpha, beta etc. use an option for this
##
## implemented as option --target=target
## please see as well option --print-target

## - implement a non-copy option:
## except for packaging, the copying of the sources is pretty useless - and even that can be changed.
## so implement an option to make emerge faster and less space consuming: don't copy the sources but 
## rely on the svn tree
##
## implemented as option --copy and --nocopy; --nocopy is standard now for all svn packages
## even packaging works from svn now
