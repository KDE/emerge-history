this is a list of things that could be done to improve emerge:

- implement "emerge --digest package":
this would create a digest file for the files needed for this package.
the advantage would be that it would not be necessary to have internet
connection to build a package any more. right now every time a package 
is built emerge tries to fetch the package, because it does not know,
if the downloaded files are complete. with a digest file it would be possible
to check if the files are already complete without an internet connection.
for ideas and code how to do so, look at the gentoo portage system.
(pretty much unclear to me)

- implement "emerge --version=version":
instead of using a different package name for each alpha, beta etc. use an option for this

- implement a non-copy option:
except for packaging, the copying of the sources is pretty useless - and even that can be changed.
so implement an option to make emerge faster and less space consuming: don't copy the sources but 
rely on the svn tree

- implement a better option transmission between calling emerge script and executed package script
- implement a function for making the settings readable by the app without the use environment vars

- make up a package for the installer
- as well with the installer:
    can there be a custom app to translate .desktop files to .lnk files?
