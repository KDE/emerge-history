this is a list of things that could be done to improve emerge:

- implement "emerge --digest package":
this would create a digest file for the files needed for this package.
the advantage would be that it would not be necessary to have internet
connection to build a package any more. right now every time a package 
is built emerge tries to fetch the package, because it does not know,
if the downloaded files are complete. with a digest file it would be possible
to check if the files are already complete without an internet connection.
for ideas and code how to do so, look at the gentoo portage system.



- check if libeay32.dll from openssl is needed. it collides with
libeay32.dll from wget
